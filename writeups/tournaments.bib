abstract = {A graph G for purposes here is a finite set of elements called vertices and a finite set of elements called edges such that each edge meets exactly two vertices, called the end-points of the edge. An edge is said to join its end-points. Jack Edmonds has been one of the creators of the field of combinatorial optimization and polyhedral combinatorics. His 1965 paper Paths, Trees, and Flowers 1 was one of the first papers to suggest the possibility of establishing a mathematical theory of efficient combinatorial algorithms . . . from the award citation of the 1985 John von Neumann Theory Prize, awarded annually since 1975 by the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. In 1962, the Chinese mathematician Mei-Ko Kwan proposed a method that could be used to minimize the lengths of routes walked by mail carriers. Much earlier, in 1736, the eminent Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who had elevated calculus to unprecedented heights, had investigated whether there existed a walk across all seven bridges that connected two islands in the river Pregel with the rest of the city of Konigsberg on the adjacent shores, a walk that would cross each bridge exactly once.},

@article{Xia2009,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the consistency analysis on listwise ranking methods. Among various ranking methods, the listwise methods have competitive performances on benchmark datasets and are regarded as one of the state-of-the-art approaches. Most listwise ranking methods manage to optimize ranking on the whole list (permutation) of objects, however, in practical applications such as information retrieval, correct ranking at the top k positions is much more important. This paper aims to analyze whether existing listwise ranking methods are statistically consistent in the top-k setting. For this purpose, we define a top-k ranking framework, where the true loss (and thus the risks) are defined on the basis of top-k subgroup of permutations. This framework can include the permutation-level ranking framework proposed in previous work as a special case. Based on the new framework, we derive sufficient conditions for a listwise ranking method to be consistent with the top-k true loss, and show an effective way of modifying the surrogate loss functions in existing methods to satisfy these conditions. Experimental results show that after the modifications, the methods can work significantly better than their original versions.},

@article{Kujansuu1999,
abstract = {In many chess tournaments the number of players is much larger than the number of rounds to be played. In such tournaments the Swiss pairing system is usually used. This means that players with equal or almost equal scores so far are played against each other. Moreover, each player should alternately have, if possible, white and black pieces, and every pair of two players is allowed to play at most once against each other. This paper shows how the well-known stable roommates algorithm can be used to determine the pairs in a pairing system similar to the Swiss system.
